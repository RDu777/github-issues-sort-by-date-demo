This pull request adds a short documentation section that proposes an explicit “Sort by date created” option for GitHub Issues.

What this PR does
Adds a new subsection to the documentation that describes a “Sort by date created” option in the Issues list UI.

Explains that users could sort issues strictly by their creation date (newest → oldest and oldest → newest).

Highlights how this option would appear in the existing “Sort” dropdown for issues.

Why this change is useful
In large repositories, maintainers and contributors often need to focus either on the most recently created issues or on very old, still open issues. A clearly labeled “Sort by date created” option would make this workflow much easier to discover and use.

It documents a concrete UX improvement idea that could later be implemented in the product, and gives users a clearer mental model of how issue sorting could work.

How it was tested
Verified that the new documentation page builds correctly and renders without formatting issues.

Checked that internal links and headings are consistent with the existing documentation structure.
